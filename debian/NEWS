polygen (1.0.6.ds2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  In order to keep the polygen binary as close as possible to the one upstream
  distributes, the Debian-specific extension that would have polygen look for
  grammar candidates in /usr/share/polygen has been moved to a wrapper script
  called polyrun.
  
  As a consequence, for most polygen invocations you should now use polyrun
  instead of polygen.

  To compensate you from the trouble of this change, this upload of polygen
  finally ships in /usr/share/polygen/eng/debian the grammars from
  http://people.debian.org/~enrico/polygen-debian.
  
  I extend you my apologies by way of "polyrun sorry", which you are invited
  to run as many time as you like, to your full satisfaction :)
