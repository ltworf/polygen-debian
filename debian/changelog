    supposed to solve all dependency problems.  Closes: #348247.

    Debian change to the upstream version.

polygen (1.0.6-9) unstable; urgency=high

  * Directly install the .grm.o files built at build time, and remove the need
    for postinst and postrm.  It removes the annoying delays at install time,
    and really closes: #325468.
  * Urgency set to high since we close a security bug (hopefully for real this
    time).
  * Need a postinst to compensate for previously existing broken postrm from
    previous polygens

 -- Enrico Zini <enrico@debian.org>  Wed, 31 Aug 2005 13:34:20 +0200

polygen (1.0.6-7) unstable; urgency=high

  * Make the polygen-data manpage build script executable before using it.
    diff doesn't preserve permissions, so the +x bit is not kept while
    packaging; that's a mismatch between how dpkg-buildpackage works and how
    one would expect it to work.  Closes: #306113.
  * Urgency is high because of the ongoing ocaml transition.

 -- Enrico Zini <enrico@debian.org>  Sun, 24 Apr 2005 13:43:11 +0200
